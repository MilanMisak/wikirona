## What is this?

This is a sample letter to be sent to your employee.
Your work place probably has an HR policy, and you should consult that.
Also, we are not lawyers, and your jurisdiction is probably different than mine.
In times of emergency, it is sometimes necessary to take the initiative.
Just as you would not go into work if the building were burning,
we think most employees in most countries should stay home,
(unless you believe the job is necessary for the greater good).

But most employers are slow to respond to the virus,
and most employees don't know what to say in those cases.
The following example letter is just an example of what you could tell your manager and HR team.

## Letter

```text
Hello <Name of Manager> and <Name of HR head>,

TODO
