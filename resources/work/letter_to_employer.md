## What is this?

This is a sample letter to be sent to your employee.
Your work place probably has an HR policy, and you should consult that.
Also, we are not lawyers, and your jurisdiction is probably different than mine.
In times of emergency, it is sometimes necessary to take the initiative.
Just as you would not go into work if the building were burning,
we think most employees in most countries should stay home,
(unless you believe the job is necessary for the greater good).

But most employers are slow to respond to the virus,
and most employees don't know what to say in those cases.
The following example letter is just an example of what you could tell your manager and HR team.

## Letter

```text
Hello <Name of Manager> and <Name of HR head>,

The WHO is now calling this COVID19 epidemic a pandemic,
and I believe that it means it's probably going to infect most of the world.

And unlike what some authorities have said,
Italy shows that the case fatality rate can be higher than expected,
and just as importantly, that hospital resources are running out,
and that we should expect the same here.

What we are hearing from Italy, South Korea, Iran, and China,
is that what we need to do now is to stay home as much as reasonable.

In China, business owners have been demanding a reduction in rent.
And in the US student loan debts are also being temporarily forgiven,
because it is a war-like emergency.

For these reasons, for my personal safety and that of others
(including those at work),
I would like to stay home for a few weeks and see what unfolds.

Thank you,
<Your naame>
