ssed in the comments here and as the premise behind the ventilator is astou=
nding. I though I would share some information to put things in perspective=
:<p>- If you are unwell enough to need a ventilator then the ventilator its=
elf is going to the least of your worries. You will need the drugs and expe=
rtise to care for you. The current respiratory illnesses going around aren=
=E2=80=99t like polio and the iron lungs where all you need is help breathi=
ng.</p><p>- If you can sort the above to have any hope of survival you need=
 a =E2=80=9Cmodern=E2=80=9D ventilator that can operate in way that this si=
mple homebrew device is physically not capable of offering. Most of the imp=
rovement in caring for people with ARDS is based upon careful and tight con=
trol of ventilatory parameters to prevent secondary lung injury.</p><p>- Mo=
dern ventilators have a price tag of if you have to ask you can=E2=80=99t a=
fford it.</p><p>So in summary this is a nice build but serves no practical =
purpose.

the underlying X, but if all I have is the vent, the patient will still die=
 from lack of perfusion. The vent didn=E2=80=99t buy any additional time, i=

flammation will be pissing off everything, including making blood vessels b=
oth leaky and dilated.</p><p>The burdened heart is now prone to being overt=
axed. With leaky vessels, it=E2=80=99s also prone to being under supplied. =
And oxygen isn=E2=80=99t coming across the lungs well. A mismatch between i=
ts blood/oxygen supply and demands causes what=E2=80=99s called a demand is=
chemia - you can think of it as a kind of heart attack. This further weaken=
s the heart.</p><p>This shortage of both supplied blood, and oxygen in the =
blood, plus systemic inflammation, can hit every other organ: kidney, liver=
, gut, etc.</p><p>This is where you can start to see some shock liver kick =
in. Which means one of our core mechanisms for metabolizing drugs (and ever=
ything else) is telling us to fuck off.</p><p>The same shock effect can hit=
 kidneys. Reduced perfusion not only hurts kidneys, but means waste dumping=
 into urine is being decreased, or not happening. We try to prop up kidney =
function. We also add fluids to try and increase perfusion (but if we have =
had an ischemia, the same bulk of fluid that is needed to maintain perfusio=
n pressure can also act as a burden on a weakened heart.)</p><p>If the gut =
goes significantly ischemic, it can die. Even if it doesn=E2=80=99t die, lo=
cal inflammation and reduced food intake can make it leaky. You=E2=80=99re =
not necessarily seeding bacteria into the blood that way (studies of pancre=
atitis w associated sepsis suggest that=E2=80=99s not a major contributor),=
 but the gut associated lymphoid tissue is definitely going to be kicking i=
nto high gear and promoting our inflammation storm even more.</p><p>So, we =
try to carefully maintain perfusion, which involves monitoring and calibrat=
ing our support for heart, kidney, lung, etc. in an ongoing and dynamic fas=
hion. And not uncommonly, besting down infections that develop along the wa=
y, because a bunch of plastic in the body is a badness.</p><p>I don=E2=80=
=99t work much in the ICU, so if I=E2=80=99ve misrepresented something and =
we have an intensivist on hand, I defer to them.

f Wuhan, about 15% of Covid-19 patients required critical care. These patie=
nts were treated with a ventilator, antiviral medications, and the support =
of an ICU. The mortality rate was about 2-3%.<p>This scenario does not scal=
e very well in a pandemic because there are simply not enough resources to =
provide this level of care to those who need it.</p><p>There are about 5000=
 ventilators in Canada, for example, meaning that the country can effective=
ly treat, at most, about 33,000 cases, assuming that the 15% ratio of total=
 sick patients to those requiring critical care holds true.</p><p>The morta=
lity figures that we have so far are based upon everyone who needs it recei=
ving critical care. As the pandemic scales, the mortality figures could eas=
ily reach 15% as the number of sick greatly exceeds the capacity to treat t=
hem.</p><p>This project shows, therefore, that someone understands the real=
 problem of Covid-19 and is attempting to solve it.</p><p>I'll take a plywo=
od ventilator over no ventilator any day of the week, even without the othe=
r resources of an ICU.</p><p>I suspect a jet ventilator would be easier to =
build and more effective under the circumstances, so maybe that should be v=

s (inotropes, sedatives, paralytics, nutritional support, bronchodilators, =
etc.) urine/foley catheter, the ability to suction the airway,  nasogastric=
 tube, bedside monitoring (arterial line, capnography, etc) potentially che=
st tube, dedicated bedside staff and access to X-rays and CT, blood work (p=
articularly Arterial blood gas analysis for mech vent) to guide process, sp=
ecialists for consults and this doesn=E2=80=99t include what else is needed=
 when other systems fails (as is this case in ARDS: kidneys can fail which =

 (requiring about 1L or sterile water every 12-24 hours) so you don=E2=80=

on the vent circuit as well.<p>Also, mechanical ventilation is an aerosol g=

ot have anywhere near the capacity needed to deal with ventilating. In HCM =
with a population of 9 million the largest hospital, Cho Ray, has 1000 beds=
 ready but only 200 intensive, and 20 ventilators. Even fewer ECMO kits. It=
s one of the best equipped hospitals in the country.=20
If things get bad, thousands will be sent home, thousands will die.
Currently we are working on ways to repurpose industrial bottles and work w=
ith local gas and liquid oxygen manufacturers to come up with stop gap solu=
tions to get oxygen to several thousand people at once, across the whole ci=
ty, using existing propane gas distribution systems and grab app for monito=
ring and delivery.=20
This is our ONLY option.=20
For those pointing out how dangerous homemade ventilators and oxy kits can =
be, assume that WE KNOW that already, and that we wouldnt be looking at thi=
s unless it looked like there being no other option.=20
We have under 700 large hospitals, but over 35,000 local clinics, many of w=
hich are run by local doctors with training and their own oxygen gear.=20
We dont need them to be perfect, we dont need them to last forever, we just=
 need them to work. If they save more than they harm, when people without t=
hem would die anyway, thats a meaningful impact.=20
And yes, Viet doctors and government will use WHATEVER they need to get sh*=
t done and save lives.</span>

                  <span class=3D"commtext c00">Exactly. The current mortali=
ty rate is predicated on the fact that people with confirmed cases are gett=
ing complete medical care. Instead it would be clearer if this were indicat=
ed as a given only because of the circumstance that there are still enough =
hospital beds for everyone being infected.<p>The more important factor is t=
he hospitalization rate. If enough people become sick and hospitals become =
overloaded with patients they cannot treat to recovery faster than the viru=
s spreads, there would be no choice but to send them elsewhere and the mort=
ality rate would drastically increase. There are only so many professional =
medical staff but the virus has no limits on the amount of people it can sp=
read to, and it sounds like the amount of continually attended medical care=
 necessary for complete recovery is substantial.</p><p>Combine that with th=
e fact that licensed virologists are giving estimates of 40-70% of the <i>g=
lobal population</i> becoming infected, and I'm beginning to question why n=
obody in my immediate circle is taking this as an imminent and serious thre=
at to their health.

of patients are not representative enough and do not contain high risk pati=

 the recent data then when number of patients approaches 100 then mortality=
 (CFR) exceeds 2%. Only exception seems to be South-Korea. Diamond Princess=

 their countries statistics.

the case of mild ARDS (early NIVPP reduces intubation rates), by the time i=
t has progressed to moderate/severe ARDS, it's too late and NIVPP isn't goi=
ng to do any good.<p>Apologies that I'm on my phone right now and don't hav=
e links at hand, but I have done some reading on this topic recently.
