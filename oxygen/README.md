# Warnings

## Oxygen is needed

* This virus attacks the lungs among many organs, and is much much deadlier than the flu.
* It is a pandemic and a significant portion (50% or more) may get infected in many countries.
* 20% of infected need hospitalization.
* Some percent(?) of the above have or will develop pneumonia.
* Some percent(?) of the above require oxygen ventiliation assistance.
* If the healthcare system gets overloaded, a non-significant portion will not get the help they need.

## DIY is not safe

"Honestly it would be cheaper more effective and FAR safer to use BIPAP or ASV machines. ASV machines are basically ventilators that do full servo assisted breathing for a patient anyway.

However there are some REALLY complex medical issues here. ASV machines are contraindicated for an patient with a weak heart because assisted breathing without the right fine tuning can cause cardiac issues and make ore-existing issues worse.

Theres a LOT more to this than just maintaining a steady breath in and out like doing rescue breathing. You have to know how to measure the breath depth, how to titrate/vary pressure on the fly, be able to add O2 (most cpaps like bipap and asv have o2 ports), measure CO2 exhalation and build up and get the algorithm right. Finally ASV isnt designed to completely breath for you, rather to assist with weak or halting breathing in situations like central apneas or similar. So they would likely need an upgrade for more severe patients or used only for mild and icu for severe.

The smartest thing in an emergency shortage would probably to grab all the ASV machines you can get IMHO.

A home built machine is ill advised." - _@cjunky from https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Pandemic-Ventilator/_

"The Covid-19 pandemic is causing a rising patient demand for respiratory Pressure Control Ventilators (PCVs). The PCV demand already exceeds the supply in some hospitals. The rapidly growing PCV shortage will force more and more hospitals to triage patients who need PCVs. More and more patients will not get them and will die. A severe PCV shortage will cause 100&apos;s of thousands of preventable deaths in the USA and Canada and millions of deaths around the world. A good design for an open-source low-cost PCV can be developed quickly by online design teams, inspired by innovative previous ventilator prototypes found around the Web. Resulting PCV designs will be quickly mass-produced byâ€¦"
