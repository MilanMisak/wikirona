by the People for the People.\
[Join us now, why wait longer?](https://join.slack.com/t/wikirona/shared_invite/zt-creubqis-YN31P7ioJb7PEZ0rOs8MhQ).

This repository is meant to host things like:

 * extra-ordinary claims with extra-ordinary proofs about COVID19
   - extent of local epidemics
   - prognosis and (case) fatality rate
   - mitigation
   - and more
 * (bio)informatic problems
 * (DIY?) masks
 * (DIY?) ventilators
 * education material
 * preparation ideas
 * protocols and proposals

_To save the most lives, we should see that this message spreads faster than the disease._

## TODO

We need to find more communities for:

1. producing Masks.
2. producing Santiizers.
3. discussions around Oxygen.
4. for allocating Beds.
5. for providing Food and Basic Necessities.
     
# Priorities for this Project

1. **Website** - The repo should be able to host it self and be auditable, based on SQL.
2. **Censorship-proof datastore integration** - e.g. blockchain backend for messages.
3. **Update Directories** - Find the best way to present a directory of *all* COVID19 information.
