## TODO

We need to find more communities for:

1. producing Masks.
2. producing Santiizers.
3. discussions around Oxygen.
4. for allocating Beds.

# Priorities for this Project

1. **Website** - The repo should be able to host it self and be auditable, based on SQL.
2. **Censorship-proof datastore integration** - e.g. blockchain backend for messages.
3. **Update Directories** - Find the best way to present a directory of *all* COVID19 information.
