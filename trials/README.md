## Clinical Trials Cooperation

Clinical trials can be difficult in Covid-19 because most patient recover spontaneously anyway, particularly for antivirals that could help in earlier stages. 
Hence a high number of patients is required in the trials to have reliable results. 
At the moment each country/institution is performing trials independently sharing the results of the trials.
A blockchain stack could improve co-operation at international level and across institutions thus speed up results and improve reliability.
