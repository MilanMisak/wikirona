# Clinical Trials Co-operation

At the moment each country/institution is performing trials independently sharing the results of the trials. This is a relatively slow and inefficient process.

Moreover clinical trials can be difficult in Covid-19 because most patient recover spontaneously regardless of cure, and the chance of false positive is high, particularly for antivirals that could help in earlier stages. This requires larger tests that can be more easily achieved via coordination.

A blockchain stack could improve co-operation at international level and across institutions thus speeding up aggregation of results and improving reliability.

## Editor Application

* API + Web + Mobile App
* Authentication/Authorization for write access, possibly per site
* Entry forms

## Data Browser and Analytics
